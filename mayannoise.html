    <h3>About mayonnaise</h3>
    <p><strong>Mayonnaise</strong>, colloquially referred to as "mayo" , is a thick, cold, and creamy sauce or dressing commonly used on sandwiches, hamburgers, composed salads, and French fries. It also forms the base for various other sauces, such as tartar sauce, fry sauce, remoulade, salsa golf, and rouille.
        <br>
        Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and an acid, either vinegar or lemon juice;there are many variants using additional flavorings. The color varies from near-white to pale yellow, and its texture from a light cream to a thick gel.
        <br>
        Commercial eggless imitations are made for those who avoid chicken eggs because of egg allergies, to limit dietary cholesterol, or because they are vegans.[5]</p>
    <h3 id="ingrediants">Ingrediants for making mayonnaise</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh squeezed lemon juice </li>
        <li>1 cup of neutral-flavored oil (like light olive oil, grapeseed oil, walnut or sweet almond oil)</li>
        <li>A pinch of good quality fine grain sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Equipment">Equipment required</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sturdy wire whisk</li>
        <li>Bowl (with high sides to prevent splashes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="procedure">Procedure for making mayonnaise</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Set aside the egg whites for another purpose (like making meringue) and place the egg yolks in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour the fresh lemon juice into the bowl with the egg yolks and whisk them well.</li>
        <li>Slowly, a few drops at a time, pour the oil into the bowl while whisking constantly. Once the mayonnaise has started to thicken, pour the oil in a slow and steady stream. If the oil starts to build up at all, stop pouring and whisk the mayonnaise briskly until the oil has incorporated.</li>
        <li>If the mayonnaise starts looking too thick, add enough water to thin it to the consistency you like. Add about a teaspoon of water at a time.</li>
        <li>Once all the oil has been mixed in, the mayonnaise should be thick and fluffy, with your whisk forming ribbons through the mixture. Season it carefully with fine grain sea salt. Add a small splash of water if you would like a thinner mayonnaise.</li>
    </ol>
